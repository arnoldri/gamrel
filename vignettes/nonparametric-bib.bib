  abstract = {This paper considers a repair-replacement strategy for a special class of discretely degrading and repairable products under renewing free replacement warranty. Each product may experience N different working states with different exponential hazard functions, before the warranty contract expires. Once the item enters working state i (i=1,2,\ldots,N), it can either fail or move to any of the subsequent working states with different probabilities, given that a transition has been made. In the former case, the best rectification action, replacement or minimal repair, regarding the failure status, i.e., the product degradation level at the failure time and the remaining warranty time, should be conducted to put the item into operation. It is assumed that replacement of the faulty item occurs instantly and the product warranty is renewed, but non-zero repair time has been included in the model. We derive the optimal replacement-repair policy to minimize the manufacturer's expected warranty servicing cost per item sold. The Adomian decomposition method is used to find an analytic approximate solution for a special case with two working states. For N$>$2, a simulation based optimization method has been developed to analyze the expected warranty cost. Some numerical examples in each section are given to clearly demonstrate the application of this model.},

A joint policy decides (a) whether or not to perform PM and (b) if PM is not performed, then how much to produce. We consider a discrete-time system, formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) model. The focus of the work is on the structural properties of optimal joint policies, given the system state comprised of the system's age and the inventory level. Although our analysis indicates that the structure of optimal joint policies is very complex in general, we are able to characterize several properties regarding PM and production, including optimal production/maintenance actions under backlogging and high inventory levels, and conditions under which the PM portion of the joint policy has a control-limit structure. In further special cases, such as when PM set-up costs are negligible compared to PM times, we are able to establish some additional structural properties. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To extend the operating life, the system can be repaired preventively. However, preventive repair does not return the system to a "good as new" condition. Rather, the successive operating times of the system after preventive repair form a stochastically decreasing geometric process, while the consecutive preventive repair times of the system form a stochastically increasing geometric process. We consider a bivariate preventive repair policy to solve the efficiency for a deteriorating \& valuable system. Thus, the objective of this paper is to determine an optimal bivariate replacement policy such that the average cost rate (i.e., the long-run average cost per unit time) is minimized. The explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived, and the corresponding optimal replacement policy can be determined numerically. An example is given where the operating time of the system is given by a Weibull distribution.},

Therefore, when nonstationary arrival processes are required, it is natural to assume Poisson arrivals with a time-varying arrival rate. For many systems, however, this provides an inaccurate representation of the arrival process that is either more or less variable than Poisson. In this paper we extend techniques that transform a stationary Poisson arrival process into a nonstationary Poisson arrival process (NSPP) by transforming a stationary renewal process into a nonstationary, non-Poisson (NSNP) arrival process. We show that the desired arrival rate is achieved and that when the renewal base process is either more or less variable than Poisson, then the NSNP process is also more or less variable, respectively, than an NSPP. We also propose techniques for specifying the renewal base process when presented properties of, or data from, an arrival process and illustrate them by modeling real arrival data.},

We will demonstrate that the proposed CARGP-TJ model not only captures the unique features of the electricity price but also performs better than other existing models. For robustness consideration, a heavy-tailed error distribution is adopted. Model implementation relies on the powerful Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques via WinBUGS software.

For a GGP, the geometric ratio changes with the number of repairs rather than being a constant. Based on the GGP, two repair-replacement models are studied. Existing preventive maintenance (PM) models based on geometric process (GP) commonly assume that the PM is `as good as new' in each working circle, which is not realistic in many situations. In this study, that the system is assumed to be geometrically deteriorating after PM or corrective maintenance (CM). Firstly, an age-dependent PM model is considered, in which the optimal policies N* and T* are obtained theoretically, and the optimal bivariate policy (N*, T*) which minimizes the average cost rate (ACR) can be determined by a searching algorithm. Next, because of the fact that the system deteriorates after maintenance, the schedule time to PM should decrease with the maintenance number increasing. Therefore, a sequential PM policy is investigated, and the optimal policy N* and the optimal schedule times T1*,T2*,\ldots,TN** are computed. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed models.},

  abstract = {Lam (2007) introduces a generalization of renewal processes named Geometric processes, where inter-arrival times are independent and identically distributed up to a multiplicative scale parameter, in a geometric fashion. We here envision a more general scaling, not necessarily geometric. The corresponding counting process is named Extended Geometric Process (EGP). Semiparametric estimates are provided and studied for an EGP, which includes consistency results and convergence rates. In a reliability context, arrivals of an EGP may stand for successive failure times of a system submitted to imperfect repairs. In this context, we study: 1) the mean number of failures on some finite horizon time; 2) a replacement policy assessed through a cost function on an infinite horizon time.},

This model assumes that the multivariate counts follow independent generalized Poisson distributions with an additional parameter to adjust for different degrees of dispersion including overdispersion and underdispersion. Their means after discounting the trend effect geometrically by ratio functions form latent stochastic processes and follow a multivariate log-t distribution with a flexible correlation structure to capture both positive correlation and negative correlation. By expressing the multivariate Student's t-distribution in scale mixtures of normals, the model can be implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms via the user-friendly WinBUGS software. The applicability of the MGPLTGP model is illustrated through an analysis of the possession and/or use of two illicit drugs, amphetamines and narcotics in New South Wales, Australia.},

Lam first proposed modelling a monotone trend by a geometric process (GP) Xi, i=1,2,\ldots{} directly such that ai-1Xi, i=1,2,\ldots{} forms a renewal process for some ratio a$>$0 which measures the direction and strength of the trend. Parameters can be conveniently estimated using the LSE methods. Previous GP models limit to data with only a single trend. For data with multiple trends, we propose a moving window technique to locate the turning point(s). The threshold GP model is fitted to the SARS data from four regions in 2003.

If the system is detected to be in working state, it will be preventively repaired, and the preventive repair brings the system to the state just as that of the beginning of the working cycle.

Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal policies N${_\ast}$ and T${_\ast}$ are derived theoretically.

Two kinds of replacement policy are considered, one based on the working age (a continuous decision variable) of the system and the other determined by the number of failures (a discrete decision variable) of the system. These policies are considered together with the performance measures, namely loss (or its complement profit), cost, and downtime (or its complement availability) respectively.

Ifa$>$1, then it is a decreasing geometric process, ifa$<$1, it is an increasing geometric process. Then, we consider a replacement model as follows: the successive survival times of the system after repair form a decreasing geometric process or a renewal process while the consecutive repair times of the system constitute an increasing geometric process or a renewal process. Besides the replacement policy based on the working age of the system, a new kind of replacement policy which is determined by the number of failures is considered. The explicit expressions of the long-run average costs per unit time under each replacement policy are then calculated, and therefore the corresponding optimal replacement policies can be found analytically or numerically.},

It fails when the total damage exceeds a failure level K and corrective maintenance is made immediately. To prevent such failure, it undergoes PM at a planned time T, a shock number N and a damage level k, but maintenances are imperfect. However, failure rate of a used system maybe higher than that of a new one, so some maintenance is applied to the policies at each shock in the extended models.

However, it possesses some limitations, which include that: (1) it can merely model stochastically increasing or decreasing inter-arrival times of recurrent event processes and (2) it cannot model recurrent event processes where the inter-arrival time distributions have varying shape parameters. Those limitations may prevent it from a wider application in the real world. In this paper, we extend the geometric process to a new process, the doubly geometric process, which overcomes the above two limitations. Probability properties are derived, and two methods of parameter estimation are given. Application of the proposed model is presented: one is on fitting warranty claim data, and the other is to compare the performance of the doubly geometric process with the performance of other widely used models in fitting real-world datasets, based on the corrected Akaike information criterion.},

The repair effect is characterized by the change induced on the failure intensity before and after failure. In the first class of models, repair effect is expressed by a reduction of failure intensity. In the second class, repair effect is expressed by a reduction of the system virtual age. In each case, several particular cases are studied, which take into account the possibility of a markovian memory property. For almost every model studied, there exists a minimal wear intensity, i.e. a maximal lower bound for failure intensity. The classification presented here involves existing models and allows the proposition of new ones. The models are compared in terms of wear-out speed. Finally, a numerical statistical study on the quality of the model parameters estimators is presented.},

The objective system is assumed to have k+1 states, including one working state and k failure states, and the multiple failure states are classified potentially by features such as failure severity or failure cause. The system deteriorates over time and will be replaced upon the Nth failure. Corrective maintenance is performed immediately upon each of the first (N-1) failures. To avoid the costly failure, preventive maintenance actions will be performed as soon as the system's reliability drops to a critical threshold R. Both preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance are assumed to be imperfect. Increasing and decreasing geometric processes are introduced to characterize the efficiency of preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. The objective is to derive an optimal maintenance policy (R*,N*) such that the long-run expected cost per unit time is minimized. The analytical expression of the cost rate function is derived, and the corresponding optimal maintenance policy can be determined numerically. A numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results and the maintaining procedure.

AP is a stochastically monotonic process and can be used to model a point process, i.e., point events occurring in a haphazard way in time (or space), especially with a trend. For example, the events may be failures arising from a deteriorating machine; and such a series of failures is distributed haphazardly along a time continuum. In this paper, we discuss estimation procedures for K independent, homogeneous APs. Two statistics are suggested for testing whether K given processes come from a common AP. If this is so, we can estimate the parameters d, $\mu$[sub \=A[sub 1]] and $\sigma{}^2$[sub \=A[sub 1] of the AP based on the techniques of simple linear regression, where $\mu$[sub \=A[sub 1]] and $\sigma{}^2$[sub \=A[sub 1]] are the mean and variance of the first average random variable \=A[sub 1], respectively. In this paper, the procedures are, for the most part, discussed in reliability terminology.

  abstract = {The repairable system with preventive maintenance is one of the typical systems with wide useful applications in engineering. If the system can be made as good as new by preventive maintenance, both the life stochastic variable of different periods and fault correction time stochastic variable form monotonous stochastic process. Based on the above assumption and the available results, in this paper we discuss the maintenance and replacement policy of the repairable system with preventive maintenance. The intervals of preventive maintenance, T, and the times of system failure, N, are introduced and the vector Markov process method is used. The formulation of steady state average profit rate can be deduced to solve the optimization problem of the maintenance and replacement policy.},

  abstract = {Reliability of a software application, its failure rate and the residual number of faults in an application are the three most important metrics that provide a quantitative assessment of the failure characteristics of an application. Typically, one of many stochastic models known as software reliability growth models (SRGMs) is used to describe the failure behavior of an application in its testing phase, and obtain an estimate of the above metrics. In order to ensure analytical tractability, SRGMs are based on an assumption of instantaneous repair and thus the estimates of the metrics obtained using SRGMs tend to be optimistic. In practice, fault repair activity consumes a nonnegligible amount of time and resources. Also, repair may be conducted according to many policies which are reflective of the schedule and budget constraints of a project. A few research efforts that have sought to incorporate repair into SRGMs are restrictive, since they consider only one of the several SRGMs, model the repair process using a constant rate, and provide an estimate of only the residual number of faults. These techniques do not address the issue of estimating application failure rate and reliability in the presence of repair. In this paper we present a generic framework which relies on the rate-based simulation technique in order to provide the capability to incorporate various repair policies into the finite failure nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) class of software reliability growth models. We also present a technique to compute the failure rate and the reliability of an application in the presence of repair. The potential of the framework to obtain quantitative estimates of the above three metrics taking into consideration different repair policies is illustrated using several scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper considers two product warranty policies proposed originally by Nguyen and Murthy in 1984. With the exception of exponential lifetimes, computing expected costs under the two policies is in general complicated. In 1988, Frees and Nam proposed an approach based on a straight line approximation of the related renewal function and showed that their approach yielded satisfactory results. In this paper we study the case in which the lifetime distribution is of phase type. We obtain simplifications by exploiting various properties of phase-type distributions. For lifetime distribution of moderate variability, our empirical observations support those of Frees and Nam. By examining the behavior of the renewal function, we offer an explanation as to why their approach works. However, when the variability of product lifetime is large and the life cycle is small, we demonstrate that the results obtained from straight line approximation is inaccurate and one of the two more accurate approaches should be used instead.},

We assume that the repair time for rectifying the claims is non-zero and the repair cost is a function of the length of the repair time. To accommodate the ageing of the product and repair equipment, we use a decreasing geometric process to model the consecutive operational times and an increasing geometric process to model the consecutive repair times. We identify and study the alternating geometric process, which is an alternating process with cycles consisting of the item?s operational time followed by the corresponding repair time. We derive new results for the alternating geometric process in a finite horizon and use them to evaluate the warranty costs over the warranty period and over the life cycle of the product under a non-renewing free repair warranty, a renewing free repair warranty and a restricted renewing free repair warranty. Properties of the model are demonstrated using a simulation study and by fitting the models to real data from an automotive manufacturer.},

Assume that shocks arrive according to a renewal process, the interarrival time of shocks has a Weibull distribution or gamma distribution. Whenever an interarrival time of shocks is less than a threshold, the system fails. Assume further the system is deteriorating so that the successive threshold values are geometrically nondecreasing, and the consecutive repair times after failure form an increasing geometric process. A replacement policy N is adopted by which the system will be replaced by an identical new one at the time following the Nth failure. Then the long-run average cost per unit time is evaluated. Afterwards, an optimal policy N* for minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time could be determined numerically.},
